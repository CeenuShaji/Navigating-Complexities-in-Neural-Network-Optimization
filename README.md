# Homework 4 Part 1

**Due: Tuesday, December 6 @ 11:59 PM**

Problem 1: **Challenges in Neural Network Training**  
Discusses common challenges like vanishing gradients, insufficient data, slow training, and overfitting in neural networks, along with strategies like batch normalization, transfer learning, momentum gradient descent, and regularization to mitigate these issues.

Problem 2: **Activation Functions and Neural Representation**  
Evaluates the capability of neural networks with linear and hard-limit activation functions to represent various mathematical functions, concluding that such networks can represent polynomials of degree one and piecewise constant functions effectively.

Problem 3: **Momentum in Neural Networks**  
Explains how momentum helps in accelerating neural network training and the potential issues of setting the momentum hyperparameter too high, which might lead to overshooting the minimum.

Problem 4: **Momentum Optimization Variants**  
Contrasts standard momentum optimization with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, highlighting Nesterov's approach to calculating gradients slightly ahead in the direction of the momentum for improved efficiency.

Problem 5: **Weight Update Mechanism in MLPs**  
Addresses the challenge of updating weights in MLP networks due to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, emphasizing the difficulty in training weights in hidden layers.

Problem 6: **Learning Curves in MLP Training**  
Involves identifying which learning curves correspond to mini-batch, batch, and online learning in MLP training, based on the characteristics of each learning approach.

Problem 7: **True Statements in Neural Network Training**  
Focuses on validating statements related to weight initialization, the role of pooling layers in CNNs, the comparison of weight connections between CNNs and MLPs, and the nature of filters in early CNN layers.
